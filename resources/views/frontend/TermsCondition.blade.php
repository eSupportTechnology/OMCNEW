                                <p>Welcome to www.myomc.lk, the online purchasing platform for OMC PLC (Sri Lanka).
                                    The myomc.lk website provides services to its valued customers under the following
                                    conditions. Please read and accept the under-mentioned conditions and guidelines
                                    carefully before using the services of this website.</p>

                                <h3 class="title-terms">Product information at myomc.lk website</h3>
                                <p>The myomc.lk website attempts to be as accurate as possible with the information
                                    displayed on the site. However, myomc.lk does not guarantee that product
                                    descriptions or other content on this site are 100% accurate, complete, reliable or
                                    completely free of errors. If a product offered by myomc.lk is not as described on
                                    the website, a customer’s sole remedy is to return it in an unused condition within two
                                    days of delivery. If there is any external damage to the package, a customer is
                                    responsible for checking the item when it is handed over. An item will not be exchanged
                                    for a refund or replacement if there is external damage e.g. packaging damage or dents.
                                    Refunds or replacements will only apply for items with confirmed technical in-built
                                    faults and are subjected to a fine or penalty for the cost. </p>

                                <p>In case the item received is found defective, customers should immediately inform
                                    myomc.lk within 24 hours to arrange a replacement with a brand-new unit or a full
                                    refund will be provided if the stock is unavailable. </p>

                                <p>Regarding the items sold through myomc.lk, the price of an item cannot be confirmed
                                    until the customer orders the item. Even though every effort is made to provide accurate
                                    pricing, there may be a negligible probability that some items can be mispriced. If the
                                    new price is higher than the mentioned price, we will not cancel or deliver the item
                                    without your confirmation about the new price, and all cancellations of items will be
                                    informed prior. If the new price is higher and you still wish to purchase, you can pay
                                    the additional amount but if you decide to cancel, we will issue a refund. </p>

                                <p>Due to current international exchange laws and conventions, even if delivery of the
                                    selected item is canceled, myomc.lk cannot refund your money. You will, however, be
                                    provided with credit on the website to purchase another available product up to the
                                    value of the previous item.</p>
